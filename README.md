# Dotfile Introduction
Welcome to my very own dotfile github repo. I've always wanted to finally create my own repo after seeing so many other great programmers', and well... here it is. Please note that this is very preliminary work since I just started learning about dotfiles since 2 weeks ago so bear with me as you'll see very very redundant and n00b-like h4ck3r.sh scripts.

## Installation
Git clone from this repo and run the install shell file:
'''
 #[Todo] draft cmd: $ git clone https://github.com/tfighter/dotfiles/Explanations/install.sh
'''

Or curl the install script and run it through your favorite shell.
'''
   $ curl -L0 https://tinyurl.com/tfdfiles | $SHELL
'''

If you don't like it so far cause it didn't get any update, then STOP cause you deserve something better. Check out github.com/dotfiles ! If you recognize parts of the code contains traces of your activity and would like it gone please create a fork and submit the code excerpt and we'll decide on the path to resolution for this type of ownership claim. Sorry for reusing the same readme from the first dotfiles original repo but screwed up making a new repo where the previous had been removed for privacy concerns.
