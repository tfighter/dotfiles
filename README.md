# Dotfile Introduction
Welcome to my very own dotfile github repo. I've always wanted to finally create my own repo after seeing so many other great programmers', and well... here it is. Please note that this is very preliminary work since I just started learning about dotfiles since 2 weeks ago so bear with me as you'll see very very redundant and n00b-like h4ck3r.sh scripts.

## Installation
